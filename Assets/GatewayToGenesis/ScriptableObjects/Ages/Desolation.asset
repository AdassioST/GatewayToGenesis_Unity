  eraDescription: The world is plunged into chaos and ruin after the catastrophic
    Shattering of Old Arcanoria.   The once-great civilization is now reduced to
    a faraway memory, dwindled to dust, and scattered survivors struggling to find
    food, shelter, and safety.   The land is littered with crumbling structures,
    decaying in remnants of a golden past and steeped in a pervasive sense of despair.
    Only slim, isolated communities form as people strive to piece together their
    shattered lives, clinging to fragments of ancient knowledge and relics for hope.
  crisisName: The Great Hunger
  crisisDescription: The collapse of ancient irrigation systems and the scarcity
    of arable land led to widespread starvation following the first population growth.
